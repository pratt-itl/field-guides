# About

The FCFG draws from over a decade of workshops produced by the [Digital Futures Group](https://www.digitalfutures.info) and compiles it into an accesible guidebook. 

Such as traditional Field Guides help the reader quickly identify and distinguish natural objects, the Future Craft Field Guide provides coverage of a widening technological ecosystem. 

## Mission Statement

Our principal objective is to augment the capabilities of the student body in an increasingly technoliterate world, with the adjancent goals of enriching and inspiring the work of our readers by minimizing the reach to grasp new technologies and providing encapsulations and applications of those technologies in the contexts of art and design.
